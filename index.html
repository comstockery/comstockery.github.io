         <p>J Dilla's <em>Donuts</em> is an album composed entirely of samples. What started as a <a href="https://www.factmag.com/2013/09/03/cassettes-cd-rs-donuts-and-zip-files-the-history-of-the-hip-hop-beat-tape/">beat tape</a> shared among friends was finalized in the final year of J Dilla's life. The album was released by Stones Throw Records on J Dilla's 32<sup>nd</sup> birthday: February 7, 2006. J Dilla died three days later.</p>
         <p><em>Sampling Donuts</em> combines information gathered from <a href="https://www.whosampled.com/album/J-Dilla/Donuts/">WhoSampled</a>&mdash;a user-populated database of known hip-hop samples&mdash;as well as applied data attributes for the timing, duration, and type of each sample's use.</p>

         <p>Of the <a href="https://www.whosampled.com/browse/">10 genre categories</a> available on WhoSampled, more than half of the samples used on <em>Donuts</em> are soul / funk / disco samples from the late 1960s or early 1970s. Some of the earliest samples are from Raymond Scott, a pioneer of early electronic music. Almost all of the samples since the early 1980s are hip-hop samples, both from the Golden Age of Hip-Hop (which was effectively ended with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Upright_Music,_Ltd._v._Warner_Bros._Records_Inc.">lawsuit against Biz Markie</a>) and from then-contemporary hip-hop artists of the early 2000s.</p>

         <span class = "quotation">"But the advent of sampling yielded a significant change: because more than one loop could now be played simultaneously, producers could take their drums and their music from different records. With samplers, any music could be combined with a great drum pattern to make what is essentially a composite break. Moreover, different loops (and "stabs"&mdash;short bursts of sound) could be brought in and taken out at different times. This substantially broadened the spectrum of music that could be pressed into service for hip-hop.</span>

      <div class = "writing">
         <p>WhoSampled provides information on which elements were used in a sample, but labeling a sample as a sound effect, hook, or drum may not capture <em>how</em> it's used in a composition. Musicologist <a href="https://twitter.com/amandasewellPhD">Dr. Amanda Sewell</a> proposed a <a href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:18431/">typology for hip-hop samples</a> to categorize them as: 
         <ul>
            <li><strong>STRUCTURAL</strong> samples, which form the harmonic and rhythmic basis of a track</li>
            <li><strong>SURFACE</strong> samples, which decorate and punctuate the structural samples, and</li>
            <li><strong>LYRIC</strong> samples, which contain comprehensible words or phrases.</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
         <p>Almost every track on <em>Donuts</em> uses one structural sample, as J Dilla rarely used material from multiple sources to compose the harmonic and rythmic basis. Despite being considered an instrumental album, almost every track includes at least one lyric sample, many of which are referenced in the track names.</p>

           <p>Dilla's use of different parts of former Temptations member Eddie Kendricks's <strong>My People...Hold On</strong> are perfect examples for the sample typology: he uses the drums in the introduction of the song as structural component, the phased heavy breathing as surface samples that come in and out of the track, and the vocals of "my people! hold on!" as a relatively straightforward lyric sample.</p>
           <p>The song <strong>Mujhe Maar Daalo</strong>, sung by Asha Bhosle, is from the 1974 Indian film <em>Geetaa Mera Naam</em>, or Geetaa is my Name. Around the same time <em>Donuts</em> was baking, Dilla's friend and collaborator Madlib was producing his <em>Beat Konducta in India</em> album, which also heavily samples from Bollywood music.</p>

           <p><strong>Lightworks</strong> might be the only track on the album that only uses samples from electronic and hip-hop sources. Dilla uses two songs from Raymond Scott, a pioneer of electronic music and inventor of several electronic instruments.</p>
           <p>Dilla creates another verbal illusion when he transforms the lyrics "light up the skies" in Raymond Scott's <strong>Lightworks</strong> into "light up the <em>spliffs</em>." The voice we hear is that of Dorothy Collins, a singer and then-wife of Raymond Scott. Dorothy often worked as a spokeswoman and vocalist in TV commercials for Lucky Strike cigarettes in the late 1950s.</p>
