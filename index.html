         <p>J Dilla's <em>Donuts</em> is an album composed entirely of samples. What started as a <a href="https://www.factmag.com/2013/09/03/cassettes-cd-rs-donuts-and-zip-files-the-history-of-the-hip-hop-beat-tape/">beat tape</a> shared among friends was finalized in the final year of J Dilla's life. The album was released by Stones Throw Records on J Dilla's 32<sup>nd</sup> birthday: February 7, 2006. J Dilla died three days later.</p>
         <p><em>Sampling Donuts</em> combines information gathered from <a href="https://www.whosampled.com/album/J-Dilla/Donuts/">WhoSampled</a>&mdash;a user-populated database of known hip-hop samples&mdash;as well as applied data attributes for the timing, duration, and type of each sample's use.</p>

         <p>Of the <a href="https://www.whosampled.com/browse/">10 genre categories</a> available on WhoSampled, more than half of the samples used on <em>Donuts</em> are soul / funk / disco samples from the late 1960s or early 1970s. Some of the earliest samples are from Raymond Scott, a pioneer of early electronic music. Almost all of the samples since the early 1980s are hip-hop samples, both from the Golden Age of Hip-Hop (which was effectively ended with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Upright_Music,_Ltd._v._Warner_Bros._Records_Inc.">copyright lawsuit against Biz Markie</a>) and from then-contemporary hip-hop artists of the early 2000s.</p>

         <p>WhoSampled provides information on which elements were used in a sample, but labeling a sample as a sound effect, hook, or drum may not capture <em>how</em> it's used in a composition. Musicologist <a href="https://twitter.com/amandasewellPhD">Dr. Amanda Sewell</a> proposed a <a href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:18431/">typology for hip-hop samples</a> to categorize them as: 
         <ul>
            <li><strong>STRUCTURAL</strong> samples, which form the harmonic and rhythmic basis of a track,</li>
            <li><strong>SURFACE</strong> samples, which decorate and punctuate the structural samples, and</li>
            <li><strong>LYRIC</strong> samples, which contain comprehensible words or phrases.</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
         <p>Almost every track on <em>Donuts</em> uses one song as its structural sample, as J Dilla rarely used material from multiple sources to compose the harmonic and rythmic foundation. Despite being considered an instrumental album, almost every track includes at least one lyric sample, many of which are referenced in the track names.</p>

There’s a guessing game and a veiling game and a process of slow disclosure: in traditional music, you see (or at least imagine) the source of the sound. [...] Here, there’s something more profoundly acousmatic&mdash;that’s music whose source you can’t see. <strong>Where are these sounds coming from?</strong>"</span>

                  <p>Some sources attribute the "Let's go!" vocal that kicks off <strong>Waves</strong> to gospel singer Kirk Franklin, but it's more likely from fellow Detroit production duo and Slum Village affiliate B.R. Gunna. On <em>Dirty District Vol. 2</em>, B.R. Gunna's <strong>Intro</strong> leads in to <strong>Do Ya Thang</strong>, which features Dilla.</p>
                  <p>Many <em>Donuts</em> fans have noted the 10cc lyrics used here, which Dilla manipulated from <strong>Johnny, Don't Do It</strong> to the affirmative: Johnny: Do it!. This may be a message of encouragement to Dilla's younger brother, Illa J, who indeed followed his brother's footsteps into hip-hop.</p>
                  <p>Faint radio-style messages are also apparent in the loop from the 10cc sample, but the source of the indecipherable female vocal snippet that <a href="https://youtu.be/vykkfDITkQs?t=50">appears at the 50-second mark</a> remains unidentified.</p>

                  <p>Dilla uses different parts of <strong>My People...Hold On</strong> from former Temptations member Eddie Kendricks in ways that illustrate the sample typology: he uses the drums in the introduction of the song as a structural component, the phased heavy breathing as a surface sample that comes in and out of the track, and the vocals of "my people! hold on!" as a straightforward lyric sample.</p>
                  <p>The song <strong>Mujhe Maar Daalo</strong>, sung by Asha Bhosle, is from the 1974 Indian film <em>Geetaa Mera Naam</em>, or <em>Geetaa is My Name</em>.

                  <p><strong>Lightworks</strong> might be the only track on the album that only uses samples from electronic and hip-hop sources. Dilla uses two songs from Raymond Scott, a pioneer of electronic music and inventor of several electronic instruments.</p>
                  <p>Dilla creates another verbal illusion when he transforms the lyrics "light up the skies" and other words in Raymond Scott's <strong>Lightworks</strong> to what sounds like "light up the <em>spliffs</em>." The voice we hear is that of Raymond's wife <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Collins">Dorothy Collins</a>. In the late 1950s, Dorothy worked as a spokesperson and vocalist in TV commercials for Lucky Strike cigarettes.</p>

                  <p>The lyric samples used in <strong>Thunder</strong> are something of a misattribution, as we don't hear vocals from any of the artists listed.</p>
                  <p>The lyric samples all come from a Motown Records live album called <em>Motortown Revue</em>, recorded in Detroit's Fox Theater. Instead of the performing artists, we hear crowd noise and the voice of the (uncredited) <a href="https://soul-concerts.fandom.com/wiki/December_25,_1968-January_1,_1969_Fox_Theatre,_Detroit,_MI?file=Image-1485179669.jpg">MC Michael Paine</a>, who introduces each act with "Ladies and gentlemen!"</p>

         <p>In 2019, the Music Sales Corporation acquired the copyright to the music of the band 10cc, whose work Dilla (allegedly) sampled. This corporation&mdash;not the artist or songwriter, but a company with the means to purchase intellectual property&mdash;<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/j-dilla-10cc-sample-lawsuit-workinonit-1053913/">sued J Dilla's estate</a>, record label, and publisher for an undisclosed amount of damages.
         </p>
         <p>Albums like <em>Donuts</em> are difficult to create in part because of the challenges of acquiring permissions for publishing rights and master rights of sampled material. The 2009 PBS documentary <a href="https://vimeo.com/9958864"><em>Copyright Criminals</em></a> and its companion book, Kembrew McLeod and Peter DiCola's <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/creative-license"><em>Creative License</em></a>, examine the law and culture of digital sampling.</p>
         <p>Among other things, the <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/copyright">American Library Association</a> advocates for changes in copyright law, including reductions in the statutory damages available to rights holders.</p>

         <p><strong>Sampling Donuts</strong> was made by Owen Comstock.</p>
         <p>Sampled song data was collected from WhoSampled. Sample type and timing data was transcribed while listening to <em>Donuts</em>. All visualizations were made in R with ggplot2.</p>
         <p>What began as a series of sketches in April 2020 was completed in December 2022 as the capstone project for the Data Analytics and Visualization program at the Maryland Institute College of Art.</p>
         <p>Many thanks to those who provided feedback and guidance as I was WORKINONIT!</p>
