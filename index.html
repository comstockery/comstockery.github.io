            <h2>What is <em>Donuts</em>? And who is J Dilla?</h2>
            <p>J Dilla's <em>Donuts</em> is an album composed <strong>entirely of samples</strong>.</p>
            <p>What started as a <a href="https://www.factmag.com/2013/09/03/cassettes-cd-rs-donuts-and-zip-files-the-history-of-the-hip-hop-beat-tape/">beat tape</a> shared among friends was finalized in the final year of the life of James Dewitt Yancey, aka Jay Dee and J Dilla.</p>
            <p>The album was released by <a href="https://www.stonesthrow.com/">Stones Throw Records</a> on J Dilla's 32<sup>nd</sup> birthday: February 7, 2006. J Dilla died from a combination of a blood disorder and lupus three days later.</p>
            <p>J Dilla produced some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Dilla_production_discography">best and most influential music of the late 1990s and early 2000s</a>. But <em>Donuts</em> was different.</p>
            <p>In Dilla's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200306171933/http://www.nodfactor.com/2010/02/07/still-lives-through-j-dillas-last-interview/">own words</a>, <em>Donuts</em> is "just a compilation of the stuff I thought was a <strong>little too much for the MCs</strong>. That’s basically what it is...me flipping records that people really don’t know how to rap on but they want to rap on."</p>
            <h2>What is <em>Sampling Donuts</em>?</h2>
            <p><em>Sampling Donuts</em> explores the use of sampled material on <em>Donuts</em>.</p>
            <p>This project uses a mix of <strong>existing</strong> and <strong>generated</strong> data.</p>
            <p>Some of the data shown here comes from <a href="https://www.whosampled.com/album/J-Dilla/Donuts/">WhoSampled</a>&mdash;a user-populated database of known hip-hop samples. WhoSampled provides information on the <strong>genre</strong> of the sampled material, as well as bibliographic information for the sampled material's <strong>song name</strong>, <strong>artist</strong>, and <strong>release year</strong>.</p>
            <p>The project also uses new data attributes for the <strong>timing</strong>, <strong>duration</strong>, and <strong>type</strong> of each instance of a sample.</p>
            <h2>What type of music did J Dilla sample from?</h2>
            <p>Of the <a href="https://www.whosampled.com/browse/">10 genre categories</a> used in WhoSampled's database, more than half of the samples used on <em>Donuts</em> are identified as <strong>soul / funk / disco</strong> samples from the late 1960s or early 1970s. Think James Brown, Eddie Kendricks, Kool and the Gang, the Isley Brothers, and Stevie Wonder.</p>
            <p>Dilla also liked to reference other <strong>hip-hop</strong>. Almost all of the samples since the early 1980s are hip-hop samples, both from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_hip_hop">Golden Age of Hip-Hop</a> and from then-contemporary hip-hop artists of the early 2000s.</p>

            <h2>How can you describe a sample?</h2>
            <p>WhoSampled provides information on which elements were used in a sample, but labeling a sample as a <strong>sound effect</strong>, <strong>hook</strong>, or <strong>drum</strong> may not capture <em>how</em> it's used in a composition.</p>
            <p>In a dissertation published in 2013, musicologist <a href="https://twitter.com/amandasewellPhD">Dr. Amanda Sewell</a> proposed a <a href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:18431/">typology for hip-hop samples</a> to categorize them as: 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>STRUCTURAL</strong> samples, which form the harmonic and rhythmic basis of a track,</li>
                <li><strong>SURFACE</strong> samples, which decorate and punctuate the structural samples, and</li>
                <li><strong>LYRIC</strong> samples, which contain comprehensible words or phrases.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>In <em>Sampling Donuts</em>, I identified each use of a sample and categorized how Dilla used it on each track.</p>
            <h2>How did Dilla use samples?</h2>
            <p>Almost every track on <em>Donuts</em> uses just one song&mdash;usually sourced from a <strong>soul / funk / disco</strong> record&mdash;as its structural sample. Dilla rarely used material from multiple sources to compose the harmonic and rythmic foundation of the tracks on <em>Donuts</em>.</p>
            <p>Despite being considered an instrumental album, almost every track includes at least one lyric sample. Many of these lyric samples are referenced in the track names.</p>
            <p>In Sewell's typology, when samples of human voices form discernable words, they're considered lyric samples&mdash;even if they aren't the words that the artist sang. However, something like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmwcYRZUPYE">James Brown grunt</a> is considered a surface sample.</p>

            <h2>How did Dilla vary his compositions on <em>Donuts</em>?</h2>
            <p>By categorizing the <strong>genre</strong> and <strong>type</strong> of each sample instance, we start to see the composition of each track.</p>
            <p>The final attribute&mdash;<strong>time</strong>&mdash;places each sample instance at its location within the track. In each of the images below, sample instances are placed in <strong>three grooves</strong> representing the three types of sample usages. The <strong>position</strong> and <strong>length</strong> of each instance within these grooves represents its timing and duration.</p>
            <p>These visuals are based in part on <a href="./adam-krims-layering-graph.png">layering graphs</a>, a notation for sample-based hip-hop developed by Adam Krims in his 2000 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Poetics-Identity-Perspectives-History-Criticism/dp/0521634474"><em>Rap Music and the Poetics of Identity</em></a>.</p>

                        <p>The Mantronix siren that kicks off the track is the most common sample on the album. That siren, from <strong>King of the Beats</strong>, hypes up various points of eight other tracks on <em>Donuts</em>.</p>

                        <p>Some sources attribute the "Let's go!" vocal that kicks off <strong>Waves</strong> to gospel singer Kirk Franklin, but it's more likely from fellow Detroit production duo and Slum Village affiliate B.R. Gunna. On <em>Dirty District Vol. 2</em>, B.R. Gunna's <strong>Intro</strong> leads in to <strong>Do Ya Thang</strong>, which features Dilla.</p>
                        <p>Many <em>Donuts</em> fans have noted the 10cc lyrics used here, which Dilla manipulated from <strong>Johnny, Don't Do It</strong> to the affirmative: Johnny, do it! This may be a message of encouragement to Dilla's younger brother John, aka Illa J, who indeed followed his brother's footsteps into hip-hop.</p>
                        <p>Faint radio-style messages are also apparent in the loop from the 10cc sample, but the source of the indecipherable female vocal snippet that <a href="https://youtu.be/vykkfDITkQs?t=50">first appears at the 50-second mark</a> remains unidentified.</p>

                        <p>One of the more bittersweet tracks on the album, <strong>Stop!</strong> is built around Dianne Warwick's <strong>You're Gonna Need Me</strong>, with the lyrics "you're gonna want me back / in your arms." The track starts with Jadakiss's laugh and a verbal illusion: Dilla transforms Jadakiss's "it's dat real!" to what you might hear as "is death real?"</p>
                        <p>This track contains the only fraction of silence on the album: about one minute into <strong>Stop!</strong>, after Dianne sings "you better stop," the music...stops.</p>

                        <p>Dilla uses different parts of <strong>My People...Hold On</strong> from former Temptations member Eddie Kendricks in ways that illustrate Sewell's sample typology: Dilla uses the drums in the introduction of the song as a <em>structural</em> component, the phased heavy breathing as a <em>surface</em> sample that comes in and out of the track, and the vocals of "my people! hold on!" as a straightforward <em>lyric</em> sample.</p>
                        <p>The song <strong>Mujhe Maar Daalo</strong>, sung by Asha Bhosle, is from the 1974 Indian film <em>Geetaa Mera Naam</em>, or <em>Geetaa is My Name</em>. Around the same time <em>Donuts</em> was baking, Dilla's friend and collaborator Madlib was producing his <a href="https://www.stonesthrow.com/store/beat-konducta-vol-3-4-beat-konducta-in-india/"><em>Beat Konducta in India</em></a> album, which also heavily samples from Bollywood soundtracks.</p>

                        <p><strong>Lightworks</strong> might be the only track on the album that only uses samples from electronic and hip-hop sources. Dilla uses two songs from Raymond Scott, a pioneer of electronic music and inventor of several electronic instruments. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Research,_Inc.">compilation of Scott's work</a> was released in 2000.</p>
                        <p>Dilla creates another verbal illusion when he transforms the lyrics "light up the skies" and other words in Raymond Scott's <strong>Lightworks</strong> to what sounds like "light up the <em>spliffs</em>." The voice we hear is that of Raymond's wife <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Collins">Dorothy Collins</a>. In the late 1950s, Dorothy worked as a spokesperson and vocalist in TV commercials for Lucky Strike cigarettes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Stepson of the Clapper</strong> may be the first track on <em>Donuts</em> to use only samples from one track. But Dilla uses it many ways: structural, surface, and lyric.</p>

                        <p>Just as the album starts with an outro, the album ends with an introduction. (On some releases of <em>Donuts</em>, this track is listed as <strong>Donuts (Intro)</strong>.)</p>
                        <p>Dilla closes out the album with Motherlode's <strong>When I Die</strong>, which contains the lyric "when I die, I hope I'll be / the kind of man that you thought I could be."</p>
                        <p>The final seconds are identical to the first seconds of the album. When played on repeat, it's a seamless transition <a href = "#starthere">right back to the beginning</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Sampling Donuts</strong> was made by <a href="mailto:owen.comstock@gmail.com">Owen Comstock</a>.</p>
            <p>Sampled song data was collected from WhoSampled. Sample type and timing data was transcribed while listening to <em>Donuts</em> at least a thousand times.</p>
            <p>All visualizations were made in R with <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> and presented here with HTML and CSS, all of which is available at my <a href="https://github.com/comstockery/comstockery.github.io">GitHub repository</a>. As a self-imposed constraint, this project did not involve Excel or Illustrator.</p>
            <p>What began as a series of sketches in April 2020 was completed in December 2022 as the <a href="https://www.mica.edu/offices-divisions/office-of-open-studies/mps-programs/mps-capstones/student/owen-comstock/">capstone project</a> for the Data Analytics and Visualization program at the <a href="https://www.mica.edu/">Maryland Institute College of Art</a>.</p>
            <p>Many thanks to those who provided encouragement, feedback, and guidance as I was WORKINONIT!</p>
