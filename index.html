    <h2>WORKINONIT! &#127849; &#127849; &#127849; </h2>

    <p>This is a work in progress... Below are rough drafts of data visualization based on J Dilla's <strong>Donuts</strong>.</p>


  <div id = "album">
        <span class="genre soul">soul / funk / disco</span>
        <span class="genre hiphop">hip-hop / rap / r & b</span>
        <span class="genre electronic">electronic / dance</span>
        <span class="genre rock">rock / pop</span>
        <span class="genre other">other</span>

    <div id = "albumlabel">
        J DILLA<br>
        <strong>DONUTS</strong><br>
        (2006)
    </div>
  </div>

    <p><strong>RUFF DRAFT visual 1:</strong> Showing the entire album</p>
    
    <p><strong>Intention:</strong> Show the entire album at once. For the entire album, the main attribute is the number of tracks. For each track, data attributes include duration, beats per minute, number of samples. Then for each sample, attributes include genre and release year. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Progress:</strong> A donut chart with 31 slices (one for each track on the album), sized by their duration. Each has some 'sprinkles' on it. The number of sprinkles per slice represents the number of unique samples per track. Sprinkles are colored based on their genre and placed radially based on their release year.</p>
    
    <p>Ideally this shows that Donuts uses plenty of soul/funk/disco samples from the late 1960s and early 1970s and hip-hop samples, both from the golden era (late 1980s) and then-contemporary (early 2000s).</p>
    
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Still to-do: 
    <ul>
      <li>Add labels for tracks (or track numbers?)</li>
      <li>Consider moving year labels out left?</li>
      <li>Consider using the beats-per-minute attribute</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

  </div>  
    
    <p><strong>RUFF DRAFT visual 2:</strong> Simpler view of the samples' genre by year</p>
    
    <p><strong>Intention:</strong> This graph only focuses on the release year of the 63 known samples in Donuts.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Progress:</strong> I feel OK about the basics here! I plan on adding the legend within HTML, not R (similar to the current chart title and units). Will add some notation near the graph that helps connect the genre colors to the values here, especially the soul/funk/disco samples from the late 1960s and early 1970s and hip-hop samples, both from the golden era (late 1980s) and early 2000s.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Still to-do: 
    <ul>
      <li>Add legend in HTML</li>
      <li>Add narrative text near figure</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>RUFF DRAFT visual 3:</strong> Type of samples and their genre by track</p>
    
    <p><strong>Intention:</strong> Introduce the type attribute and show how different genres are used.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Progress:</strong> The data is close but not quite correct. Need to revisit my piping that formed the dataframe.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Still to-do: 
    <ul>
      <li>Add legend in HTML</li>
      <li>Add narrative text near figure</li>
      <li>Clean up theme</li>
      <li>Fix data pipe</li>

    <p><strong>RUFF DRAFT visual 4:</strong> Generations of samples</p>
    
    <p><strong>Intention:</strong> Display the multiple generations of music contained within certain Donuts samples.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Progress:</strong> Pulled the data for the samples within Mantronix's King of the Beats, the most-used sample on Donuts.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> I'm not sure if this counts as a "visualization" so I need to double-check on that. I want to make this an interactive element with <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_collapse.asp">Bootstrap collapse</a>. The interactive nature of this approach would be similar to the practice of reading albums' credits and liner notes to discover connections and influences. Other samples I'd explore are Run-DMC's Here We Go (Live at the Funhouse), the Beastie Boys' The New Style, and Jaylib's No Games.</p>

<img src="LIGHTMYFIRE.svg">

    <p><strong>RUFF DRAFT visual 5:</strong> Track-by-track donut charts</p>
    
    <p><strong>Intention:</strong> Display the samples used within each track on Donuts. Think of each track 'starting' at the 12:00 position, then rotating clockwise you encounter each sample based on its timing. The positions within the 'record grooves' reflect how those samples are used on the Donuts track: structural, surface, and lyric. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Progress:</strong> I have the data for all of the samples but need to set up a consistent scheme so that these can be batch-generated in R.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> I think I'm going to have an issue labeling the sampled tracks and artists. I haven't figured out a way to label those without overlapping the data itself. I hope to avoid requiring mouseover for labeling.</p>
