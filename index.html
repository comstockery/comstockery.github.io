    <p><strong>WORKINONIT!</strong></p>

    <p>I plan on using this site to build out a data visualization based on J Dilla's <strong>Donuts</strong>.</p>
  

  <div class = "album">
    <img src="donutrecord.svg">
    <div class = "albumlabel">
        J DILLA<br>
        <strong>DONUTS</strong>
    </div>
  </div>

    <p><strong>RUFF DRAFT visual 1:</strong> the entire album</p>
    
    <p><strong>Intention:</strong> Show the entire album at once. For the entire album, the main attribute is the number of tracks. For each track, data attributes include duration, beats per minute, number of samples. Then for each sample, attributes include genre and release year. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Progress:</strong> A donut chart with 31 slices (one for each track on the album), sized by their duration.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Next up:</strong> Place sprinkles on the donut. Each sprinkle represents a sample within that track. Sprinkles are colored based on their genre and located (distance from radius) based on their release year.</p>
