            <h2>What is <em>Donuts</em>? And who is J Dilla?</h2>
            <p>J Dilla's <em>Donuts</em> is an album composed <strong>entirely of samples</strong>.</p>
            <p>What started as a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.factmag.com/2013/09/03/cassettes-cd-rs-donuts-and-zip-files-the-history-of-the-hip-hop-beat-tape/">beat tape</a> shared among friends was finalized in the final year of the life of James Dewitt Yancey, who was also known as Jay Dee but best known as J Dilla.</p>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.stonesthrow.com/">Stones Throw Records</a> released <em>Donuts</em> on J Dilla's 32<sup>nd</sup> birthday: February 7, 2006. J Dilla died from a combination of a blood disorder and lupus three days later.</p>
            <p>J Dilla produced some of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Dilla_production_discography">best and most influential music of the late 1990s and early 2000s</a>. But <em>Donuts</em> was different.</p>
            <p>In Dilla's <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200306171933/http://www.nodfactor.com/2010/02/07/still-lives-through-j-dillas-last-interview/">own words</a>, <em>Donuts</em> is "just a compilation of the stuff I thought was a <strong>little too much for the MCs</strong>. That’s basically what it is...me flipping records that people really don’t know how to rap on but they want to rap on."</p>
            <h2>What is <em>Sampling Donuts</em>?</h2>
            <p><em>Sampling Donuts</em> explores the use of sampled material on <em>Donuts</em>.</p>
            <p>This project uses a mix of <strong>existing</strong> and <strong>generated</strong> data.</p>
            <p>Some of the data shown here comes from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whosampled.com/album/J-Dilla/Donuts/">WhoSampled</a>&mdash;a user-populated database of known hip-hop samples. WhoSampled provides information on the <strong>genre</strong> of the sampled material, as well as bibliographic information for the sampled material's <strong>song name</strong>, <strong>artist</strong>, and <strong>release year</strong>.</p>
            <p>The project also uses new data attributes for the <strong>timing</strong>, <strong>duration</strong>, and <strong>type</strong> of each instance of a sample.</p>
            <h2>What type of music did J Dilla sample from?</h2>
            <p>Users who submit information to WhoSampled can assign <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whosampled.com/browse/">one of ten genres</a> to a sampled song. More than half of the samples used on <em>Donuts</em> are labeled by users as <strong>soul / funk / disco</strong> samples from the late 1960s or early 1970s. Think James Brown, Eddie Kendricks, Kool and the Gang, the Isley Brothers, and Stevie Wonder.</p>
            <p>Dilla also liked to reference other <strong>hip-hop</strong>. Almost all of the samples since the early 1980s are hip-hop samples, both from the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_hip_hop">Golden Age of Hip-Hop</a> and from then-contemporary hip-hop artists of the early 2000s.</p>

            <h2>How can you describe a sample?</h2>
            <p>WhoSampled provides information on which elements were used in a sample, but labeling a sample as a <strong>sound effect</strong>, <strong>hook</strong>, or <strong>drum</strong> may not capture <em>how</em> it's used in a composition.</p>
            <p>In a dissertation published in 2013, musicologist <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/amandasewellPhD">Dr. Amanda Sewell</a> proposed a <a target="_blank" href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:18431/">typology for hip-hop samples</a> to categorize them as: 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>STRUCTURAL</strong> samples, which form the harmonic and rhythmic basis of a track,</li>
                <li><strong>SURFACE</strong> samples, which decorate and punctuate the structural samples, and</li>
                <li><strong>LYRIC</strong> samples, which contain comprehensible words or phrases.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>In <em>Sampling Donuts</em>, each instance of a sample is categorized based on how Dilla used it on each track.</p>
            <h2>How did Dilla use samples?</h2>
            <p>Almost every track on <em>Donuts</em> uses just one song&mdash;usually sourced from a <strong>soul / funk / disco</strong> record&mdash;as its structural sample. Dilla rarely used material from multiple sources to compose the harmonic and rythmic foundation of a track.</p>
            <p>Despite being considered an instrumental album, almost every track includes at least one lyric sample; only two tracks have no lyric samples. Many of the lyric samples are referenced in the track names.</p>

            <h2>How did Dilla vary his compositions on <em>Donuts</em>?</h2>
            <p>By categorizing the <strong>genre</strong> and <strong>type</strong> of each sample instance, we start to see the composition of each track.</p>
            <p>The final attribute&mdash;<strong>time</strong>&mdash;places each sample instance at its location within the track. In each of the images below, sample instances are placed in <strong>three grooves</strong> representing the three types of samples in Sewell's typology. The <strong>position</strong> and <strong>length</strong> of each instance within these grooves represents its timing and duration.</p>
            <p>These visuals are based in part on <a target="_blank" href="./adam-krims-layering-graph.png">layering graphs</a>, a notation for sample-based hip-hop developed by Adam Krims in his 2000 book <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Poetics-Identity-Perspectives-History-Criticism/dp/0521634474"><em>Rap Music and the Poetics of Identity</em></a>.</p>

                        <p>That's no mistake&mdash;the first track on the album is labeled as an outro.</p>
                        <p>After dropping an "I don't care" from Gary Davis, Dilla introduces himself by twisting lyric samples from Skillz and Ras Kass's <strong>Six Figures</strong>. Two phrases in Skillz's second verse, "hit up <em>Jake</em>?" and "you a <em>dealer</em>?" are turned into what we hear as "J, J, J Dilla...Dilla...Dilla..."</p>
                        <p>This introduction resembles the way Pete Rock <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whosampled.com/sample/6782/Pete-Rock-%26-C.L.-Smooth-In-the-House-A-Tribe-Called-Quest-Verses-From-the-Abstract/">names himself and C.L. Smooth</a> on <strong>In the House</strong>, the intro to their album <em>The Main Ingredient</em>, which was among Dilla's favorites. But instead of sampling his name directly (as Pete Rock was able to, using Q-Tip's voice from A Tribe Called Quest's <strong>Verses From the Abstract</strong>), Dilla crafted his name from other words.</p>
                        <p>It's fitting that Skillz introduces Dilla, as Skillz was the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.streetopia.me/m/news/601db28d2737492b2c7c6523/dilla-month-the-30-essential-albums-to-know-and-comprehend-j-dilla">first artist to officially record a Jay Dee song</a>: his <strong>From Where???</strong> was recorded in 1994 and included on Skillz's 1996 debut.</p>

                        <p><strong>Workinonit</strong>, the longest and most complex track on <em>Donuts</em>, presents the album in minature form. Almost every sample reappears later in the album.</p>
                        <p>The Mantronix siren that kicks off the track is the most common sample on the album. That siren, from <strong>King of the Beats</strong>, hypes up various points of eight other tracks on <em>Donuts</em>.</p>

                        <p>Some sources attribute the "Let's go!" vocal that kicks off <strong>Waves</strong> to gospel singer Kirk Franklin, but it's more likely from fellow Detroit production duo and Slum Village affiliate B.R. Gunna. On <em>Dirty District Vol. 2</em>, B.R. Gunna's <strong>Intro</strong> leads in to <strong>Do Ya Thang</strong>, which features Dilla.</p>
                        <p>Many <em>Donuts</em> fans have noted the 10cc lyrics used here, which Dilla manipulated from <strong>Johnny, Don't Do It</strong> to the affirmative: Johnny, do it! This may be a message of encouragement to Dilla's younger brother John, aka Illa J, who indeed followed his brother's footsteps into hip-hop.</p>
                        <p>Faint radio-style messages are also apparent in the loop from the 10cc sample, but the source of the indecipherable female vocal snippet that <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/vykkfDITkQs?t=50">first appears at the 50-second mark</a> is unknown.</p>

                        <p>Dilla uses different parts of <strong>My People...Hold On</strong> from former Temptations member Eddie Kendricks in ways that illustrate Sewell's sample typology: Dilla uses the drums in the introduction of the song as a structural component, the phased heavy breathing as a surface sample that comes in and out of the track, and the vocals of "my people! hold on!" as a straightforward lyric sample.</p>
                        <p>The song <strong>Mujhe Maar Daalo</strong>, sung by Asha Bhosle, is from the 1974 Indian film <em>Geetaa Mera Naam</em>, or <em>Geetaa is My Name</em>.

The Stones Throw comp included MF DOOM and Guilty Simpson rapping over <strong>Mash</strong> in a track titled <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7pOKOaRycE"><strong>Mash's Revenge</strong></a>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mash</strong> is built upon a sample from Galt MacDermot, who most famously composed the music for <em>Hair</em> but also produced soundtracks for films including the Blaxploitation movie <em>Cotton Comes to Harlem</em>.</p>
                        <p>MacDermot worked with some of the best funk/jazz drummers of the time, including Bernard Purdie, Jimmy Lewis, and Idris Muhammad, making his music <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galt_MacDermot#Samples_and_other_use">popular with hip-hop producers</a>.</p>

Compared to the other beats, <strong>Glazed</strong> is downright unpleasant... Dilla takes a one-bar horn break from Gene and Jerry's <strong>You Just Can't Win</strong> and loops it <em>ad infinitum</em>. It's noisy, punishing, grueling, impossible to be anything besides what it is: What MC would ever try to rhyme over that?"</p>

                        <p>The first words on <em>Donuts</em> are a lyric sample: "I don't care." That seemingly flippant mantra is revisited on <strong>Airworks</strong> with L.V. Johnson's <strong>I Don't Really Care</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Madlib also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrufdBpn1L8">used this sample material</a> for Strong Arm Steady's <strong>Chittlins &amp; Pepsi</strong> on 2010's <em>In Search of Stoney Jackson</em> album.</p>
                        <p>YouTuber Narokx posts sample breakdowns of a few tracks on <em>Donuts</em>, including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEEGoOOYCsM">his re-creation of <strong>Airworks</strong></a>. In the comments, he admits: "THIS IS IT&mdash;the most challenging breakdown I've done, by a mile!!"</p>
                        <p>The title fits with the next <em>Donuts</em> track, <strong>Lightworks</strong>. Both tracks contain Raymond Scott's commercial jingles as surface samples. Dilla incorporates the Raymond Scott sample at the end of this track in a way that makes the transition quick and seamless.</p>

                        <p><strong>Lightworks</strong> might be the only track on the album that samples exclusively from electronic and hip-hop sources. Dilla uses two songs from Raymond Scott, a pioneer of electronic music and inventor of several electronic instruments. A <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Research,_Inc.">compilation of Scott's work</a> was released in 2000.</p>
                        <p>Dilla creates another verbal illusion when he transforms the lyrics "light up the skies" and other words in Raymond Scott's <strong>Lightworks</strong> to what sounds like "light up the <em>spliffs</em>." The voice we hear is that of Raymond's wife <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Collins">Dorothy Collins</a>. In the late 1950s, Dorothy worked as a spokesperson and vocalist in TV commercials for Lucky Strike cigarettes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Stepson of the Clapper</strong> may be the first track on <em>Donuts</em> to use only samples from one track. But Dilla uses it many ways: structural, surface, and lyric.</p>
                        <p>Mountain's live performance of <strong>Long Red</strong> contains one of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whosampled.com/Mountain/Long-Red/">most-sampled drum breaks</a> in all of hip-hop; it's been sampled by EPMD, A Tribe Called Quest, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Nas, and Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth.</p>
                        <p>Through the lyric samples of Mountain's banter with the audience, Dilla asks us to clap along, then mocks us: "Wrong tempo!"</p>
                        <p>The title may be a callback to <strong>The Clapper</strong>, a track on his debut album <em>Welcome 2 Detroit</em> that was also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whosampled.com/sample/748369/Jaylib-The-Mission-Jay-Dee-Blu-(2)-The-Clapper/">sampled by Madlib</a> on Jaylib's <em>Champion Sound</em> track, <strong>The Mission</strong>.</p>

                        <p><strong>Anti-American Graffiti</strong> contains lyric samples that may speak to Dilla wrestling with his medical condition and fate.

                        <p>Wolfman Jack's appearance in the film <em>American Graffiti</em> is likely the source for this track's title.</p>

Creating one of the most-sampled pieces of music may not be that lucrative, though: in 1992 ESG released an EP titled <em>Sample Credits Don't Pay Our Bills</em>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Charlie's Theme</strong> is one of two songs released by the Jimi Entley Sound, a side project from Portishead members Geoff Barrow and Adrian Utley. Dilla may have been interested in this 2002 single for its A-side, a cover of the Incredible Bongo Band's <strong>Apache</strong>, a song which contains one of the most recognizable drum breaks in all of hip-hop.</p>
                        <p>But here, Dilla used the single's B-side, a cover of the main theme to a 1973 British biker zombie horror film: <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychomania"><em>Psychomania</em></a>. The original theme was credited to the band Frog, a pseudonym for composer <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cameron_(musician)">John Cameron</a>.</p>

                        <p><strong>Gobstopper</strong> and the next track, <strong>One for Ghost</strong>, should be considered a pair, as they both are built around Luther Ingram's <strong>To the Other Man</strong>. Of course, Dilla pulled samples from different parts of the song, so this connection isn't obvious. The use of the Mantronix siren also ties these tracks together.</p>
                        <p>With no lyric samples and a relatively straightforward loop, <strong>Gobstopper</strong> may be the best track on the album to rap over. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whosampled.com/sample/110296/Busta-Rhymes-Rah-Digga-The-Range-J-Dilla-Gobstopper/">Busta Rhymes and Rah Digga</a> used the track on 2007's <em>Dillagence</em> tribute album. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whosampled.com/sample/558101/Jay-Electronica-Abracadabra-J-Dilla-Gobstopper/">Jay Electronica</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whosampled.com/sample/309959/Nas-The-Season-J-Dilla-Gobstopper/">Nas</a> have also used <strong>Gobstopper</strong>.</p>
                        <p>The track may have gotten its name for its ability to go on and on, like an <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everlasting_Gobstopper">Everlasting Gobstopper</a>, as made clear in YouTuber Sunset Loops's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P62KYqsr35g">hour-long version</a> of this track.</p>

                        <p>Jaylib's <strong>No Games</strong> is sampled here, a track from <em>Champion Sound</em>, the beat tape that evolved into a long-distance collaboration between Dilla and Madlib. It started in 2000 when J Rocc gave a CD of unused Dilla beats to Madlib, who rapped over them, but with no intention of releasing the tracks commercially.</p>
                        <p>Without telling Dilla, Stones Throw put one of these tracks on Madlib single and credited the track to Jaylib. Eventually, Dilla returned the honor, rapping over unreleased Madlib beats. <em>Champion Sound</em> mostly alternates in that pattern: a Madlib-produced track with J Dilla raps and Dilla-produced track with Madlib raps.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the album was a commercial flop for Stones Throw and was soon overshadowed by Madlib's <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madvillainy">heralded collaboration with MF DOOM as Madvilliain</a>.</p>

                        <p>Otherwise, the sample sources here are among the weirdest music included on <em>Donuts</em>.

                        <p><strong>The Factory</strong> contains the last use of the siren from Mantronix's <strong>King of the Beats</strong>, by far the most frequently used sample on the album. Mantronix <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whosampled.com/sample/679458/Mantronix-King-of-the-Beats-Adams-%26-Fleisner-Pulsar-City-Alarm/">likely sampled the siren</a> from a track called <strong>Pulsar City Alarm</strong>.

                        <p>The use of samples from B.R.

                        <p>Like <strong>One for Ghost</strong>, this track reappeared on Ghostface Killah's <em>Fishscale</em> album as the foundation for <a target="_blank" href="https://genius.com/Ghostface-killah-beauty-jackson-lyrics"><strong>Beauty Jackson</strong></a>.</p>
                        <p>Dilla had an <a target="_blank" href="https://classicalbumsundays.com/album-of-the-month-j-dilla-donuts/">unusual arrangement</a> with Stones Throw Records in that the music on <em>Donuts</em> wouldn't necessarily be exclusive to the album; Dilla was free to use the beats in his production work with other artists.</p>

                        <p>Why are the tracks on the album called donuts?</p>
                        <p>At the end of Dilla's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/14/arts/music/james-yancey-producer-known-for-soulful-hiphop-dies-at-32.html"><em>New York Times</em> obituary</a>, they cite a Stones Throw press release that answered this question: "Easy explanation. Dilla likes donuts."</p>
                        <p>There's slightly more to it. According to <a target="_blank" href="https://dillati.me/"><em>Dilla Time</em></a> author Dan Charnas, in late 2005, Dilla was with Madlib and Stones Throw records owner Peanut Butter Wolf. After a record shopping trip in Los Angeles's Silver Lake neighborhood, "[J Dilla] played them a new CD of beats... He'd given it one of his playful titles that derived from the name of some unhealthy food that he shouldn't be eating in his condition, like <em>Burger King</em>, <em>Pizza Man</em>, or in this case, <strong><em>Donuts</em></strong>."</p>

                        <p>Just as the album starts with an outro, the album ends with an introduction. On some releases of <em>Donuts</em>, this track is <a target="_blank" href="https://i.discogs.com/OEwkWzozoek-mlA9wfd37gBbomftjsFYi8R0UtbbWys/rs:fit/g:sm/q:90/h:600/w:600/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9SLTU1MDMy/MTItMTQzNzg2MDc2/OC02MDc3LmpwZWc.jpeg">listed as <strong>Donuts (Intro)</strong></a>.</p>
                        <p>Dilla closes out the album with Motherlode's <strong>When I Die</strong>, which contains the lyric "when I die, I hope I'll be / the kind of man that you thought I could be."</p>
                        <p>The final seconds are identical to the first seconds of the album, a trick that might have been one of Jeff Jank's contributions when editing and compiling the album. When played on repeat, it's a seamless transition <a href = "#starthere">right back to the beginning</a>. Full circle!</p>

            <p><em><strong>Sampling Donuts</strong></em> was made by <a target="_blank" href="mailto:owen.comstock@gmail.com?subject=Sampling Donuts!">Owen Comstock</a> and was longlisted for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/6405-sampling-donuts">2023 Information is Beautiful awards</a>!</p>
            <p>Sampled song data mostly came from 90-something WhoSampled pages, with minor modifications for accuracy and consistency. Each sample instance's type and timing attributes were assigned and transcribed while listening to <em>Donuts</em> at least a thousand times.</p>
            <p>All visualizations were made in R with <a target="_blank" href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> and presented here with HTML and CSS. The code is available at my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/comstockery/comstockery.github.io">GitHub repository</a>. As a self-imposed constraint, this project did not involve Microsoft Excel or Adobe Illustrator.</p>
            <p>What began as a series of sketches in April 2020 was partially completed in December 2022 as the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mica.edu/offices-divisions/office-of-open-studies/mps-programs/mps-capstones/student/owen-comstock/">capstone project</a> for the Data Analytics and Visualization program at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mica.edu/">Maryland Institute College of Art</a>. The project was finalized in mid-2023 by writing liner notes for each track and addressing feedback from the capstone review.</p>
            <p>Many thanks to those who provided encouragement, feedback, and guidance as I was WORKINONIT!</p>
