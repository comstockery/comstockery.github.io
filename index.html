      <h2>What is <em>Donuts</em>? And who is J Dilla?</h2>
         <p>J Dilla's <em>Donuts</em> is an album composed <strong>entirely of samples</strong>.</p>
         <p>What started as a <a href="https://www.factmag.com/2013/09/03/cassettes-cd-rs-donuts-and-zip-files-the-history-of-the-hip-hop-beat-tape/">beat tape</a> shared among friends was finalized in the final year of the life of James Dewitt Yancey, aka Jay Dee and J Dilla.</p>
         <p>The album was released by <a href="https://www.stonesthrow.com/">Stones Throw Records</a> on J Dilla's 32<sup>nd</sup> birthday: February 7, 2006. J Dilla died from a combination of a blood disorder and lupus three days later.</p>
         <p>J Dilla produced some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Dilla_production_discography">best and most influential music of the late 1990s and early 2000s</a>. But <em>Donuts</em> was different.</p>
         <p>In Dilla's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200306171933/http://www.nodfactor.com/2010/02/07/still-lives-through-j-dillas-last-interview/">own words</a>, <em>Donuts</em> is "just a compilation of the stuff I thought was a <strong>little too much for the MCs</strong>. That’s basically what it is...me flipping records that people really don’t know how to rap on but they want to rap on."</p>
      
      <h3>What is <em>Sampling Donuts</em>?</h3>
         <p><em>Sampling Donuts</em> explores the use of sampled material on <em>Donuts</em>.</p>
         <p>This project uses a mix of <strong>existing</strong> and <strong>generated</strong> data.</p>
         <p>Some of the data shown here comes from <a href="https://www.whosampled.com/album/J-Dilla/Donuts/">WhoSampled</a>&mdash;a user-populated database of known hip-hop samples. WhoSampled provides information on the <strong>genre</strong> of the sampled material, as well as bibliographic information for the sampled material's <strong>song name</strong>, <strong>artist</strong>, and <strong>release year</strong>.</p>
         <p>The project also uses new data attributes for the <strong>timing</strong>, <strong>duration</strong>, and <strong>type</strong> of each instance of a sample.</p>

      <h3>What type of music did J Dilla sample from?</h3>
         <p>Of the <a href="https://www.whosampled.com/browse/">10 genre categories</a> used in WhoSampled's database, more than half of the samples used on <em>Donuts</em> are identified as <strong>soul / funk / disco</strong> samples from the late 1960s or early 1970s. Think James Brown, Eddie Kendricks, Kool and the Gang, the Isley Brothers, and Stevie Wonder.</p>
         <p>Dilla also liked to reference other <strong>hip-hop</strong>. Almost all of the samples since the early 1980s are hip-hop samples, both from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_hip_hop">Golden Age of Hip-Hop</a> and from then-contemporary hip-hop artists of the early 2000s.</p>

        <h3>How can you describe a sample?</h3>
         <p>WhoSampled provides information on which elements were used in a sample, but labeling a sample as a <strong>sound effect</strong>, <strong>hook</strong>, or <strong>drum</strong> may not capture <em>how</em> it's used in a composition.</p>
         <p>In a dissertation published in 2013, musicologist <a href="https://twitter.com/amandasewellPhD">Dr. Amanda Sewell</a> proposed a <a href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:18431/">typology for hip-hop samples</a> to categorize them as: 
         <ul>
            <li><strong>STRUCTURAL</strong> samples, which form the harmonic and rhythmic basis of a track,</li>
            <li><strong>SURFACE</strong> samples, which decorate and punctuate the structural samples, and</li>
            <li><strong>LYRIC</strong> samples, which contain comprehensible words or phrases.</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
         <p>In <em>Sampling Donuts</em>, I identified each use of a sample and categorized how Dilla used it on each track.</p>
         <h3>How did Dilla use samples?</h3>
         <p>Almost every track on <em>Donuts</em> uses just one song&mdash;usually sourced from a <strong>soul / funk / disco</strong> record&mdash;as its structural sample. Dilla rarely used material from multiple sources to compose the harmonic and rythmic foundation of the tracks on <em>Donuts</em>.</p>
         <p>Despite being considered an instrumental album, almost every track includes at least one lyric sample. Many of these lyric samples are referenced in the track names.</p>
         <p>In Sewell's typology, when samples of human voices form discernable words, they're considered lyric samples&mdash;even if they aren't the words that the artist sang. However, something like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmwcYRZUPYE">James Brown grunt</a> is considered a surface sample.</p>

        <h3>How did Dilla vary his compositions on <em>Donuts</em>?</h3>
         <p>By categorizing the <strong>genre</strong> and <strong>type</strong> of each sample instance, we start to see the composition of each track.</p>
         <p>The final attribute&mdash;<strong>time</strong>&mdash;places each sample instance at its location within the track. In each of the images below, sample instances are placed in <strong>three grooves</strong> representing the three types of sample usages. The <strong>position</strong> and <strong>length</strong> of each instance within these grooves represents its timing and duration.</p>
         <p>These visuals are based in part on <a href="./adam-krims-layering-graph.png">layering graphs</a>, a notation for sample-based hip-hop developed by Adam Krims in his 2000 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Poetics-Identity-Perspectives-History-Criticism/dp/0521634474"><em>Rap Music and the Poetics of Identity</em></a>.</p>

                  <p>Some sources attribute the "Let's go!" vocal that kicks off <strong>Waves</strong> to gospel singer Kirk Franklin, but it's more likely from fellow Detroit production duo and Slum Village affiliate B.R. Gunna. On <em>Dirty District Vol. 2</em>, B.R. Gunna's <strong>Intro</strong> leads in to <strong>Do Ya Thang</strong>, which features Dilla.</p>
                  <p>Many <em>Donuts</em> fans have noted the 10cc lyrics used here, which Dilla manipulated from <strong>Johnny, Don't Do It</strong> to the affirmative: Johnny: Do it!. This may be a message of encouragement to Dilla's younger brother, Illa J, who indeed followed his brother's footsteps into hip-hop.</p>
                  <p>Faint radio-style messages are also apparent in the loop from the 10cc sample, but the source of the indecipherable female vocal snippet that <a href="https://youtu.be/vykkfDITkQs?t=50">appears at the 50-second mark</a> remains unidentified.</p>

                  <p>Dilla uses different parts of <strong>My People...Hold On</strong> from former Temptations member Eddie Kendricks in ways that illustrate the sample typology: he uses the drums in the introduction of the song as a structural component, the phased heavy breathing as a surface sample that comes in and out of the track, and the vocals of "my people! hold on!" as a straightforward lyric sample.</p>
                  <p>The song <strong>Mujhe Maar Daalo</strong>, sung by Asha Bhosle, is from the 1974 Indian film <em>Geetaa Mera Naam</em>, or <em>Geetaa is My Name</em>.

                  <p><strong>Lightworks</strong> might be the only track on the album that only uses samples from electronic and hip-hop sources. Dilla uses two songs from Raymond Scott, a pioneer of electronic music and inventor of several electronic instruments.</p>
                  <p>Dilla creates another verbal illusion when he transforms the lyrics "light up the skies" and other words in Raymond Scott's <strong>Lightworks</strong> to what sounds like "light up the <em>spliffs</em>." The voice we hear is that of Raymond's wife <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Collins">Dorothy Collins</a>. In the late 1950s, Dorothy worked as a spokesperson and vocalist in TV commercials for Lucky Strike cigarettes.</p>

                  <p>The lyric samples used in <strong>Thunder</strong> are something of a misattribution, as we don't hear vocals from any of the artists listed.</p>
                  <p>The lyric samples all come from a Motown Records live album called <em>Motortown Revue</em>, recorded in Detroit's Fox Theater. Instead of the performing artists, we hear crowd noise and the voice of the (uncredited) <a href="https://soul-concerts.fandom.com/wiki/December_25,_1968-January_1,_1969_Fox_Theatre,_Detroit,_MI?file=Image-1485179669.jpg">MC Michael Paine</a>, who introduces each act with "Ladies and gentlemen!"</p>

         <p>In 2019, the Music Sales Corporation acquired the copyright to the music of the band 10cc, whose work Dilla (allegedly) sampled. This corporation&mdash;not the artist or songwriter, but a company with the means to purchase intellectual property&mdash;<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/j-dilla-10cc-sample-lawsuit-workinonit-1053913/">sued J Dilla's estate</a>, record label, and publisher for an undisclosed amount of damages.
         </p>
         <p>Albums like <em>Donuts</em> are difficult to create in part because of the challenges of acquiring permissions for publishing rights and master rights of sampled material. The 2009 PBS documentary <a href="https://vimeo.com/9958864"><em>Copyright Criminals</em></a> and its companion book, Kembrew McLeod and Peter DiCola's <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/creative-license"><em>Creative License</em></a>, examine the law and culture of digital sampling.</p>
         <p>Among other things, the <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/copyright">American Library Association</a> advocates for changes in copyright law, including reductions in the statutory damages available to rights holders.</p>

         <p><strong>Sampling Donuts</strong> was made by Owen Comstock.</p>
         <p>Sampled song data was collected from WhoSampled. Sample type and timing data was transcribed while listening to <em>Donuts</em>. All visualizations were made in R with ggplot2.</p>
         <p>What began as a series of sketches in April 2020 was completed in December 2022 as the capstone project for the Data Analytics and Visualization program at the Maryland Institute College of Art.</p>
